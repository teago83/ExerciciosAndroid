Begin by adding a permission for the app to use the Internet.
After having referenced the Button and the TextView on the code itself, create an OnClickListener for the button and create
a class for the fetched data, extending it from "AsyncTask".
On the FetchData class, firstly, declare the 'doInBackground' function and the 'onPostExecute' function, too. The first one
does stuff in the background (like picking up the URL with the JSON data), while the second one changes the UI in the app
itself.
Declare an URL object and assign the link to the JSON data to it. 
After that, create an HttpURLConnection, an InputStream and a BufferedReader, as they're all necessary to connect the app
to the URL and to read its data. 
Finally, create a "ParsedData" string, where the parsed version of the data from the URL shall be stored and, basically, 
you'll just need to create a JSONObject to get the JSON data's attributes and assign them to the ParsedData string and 
you're done.
